# Ogre Accelerator Driver

This codebase simulates a driver for a fictional hardware accelerator called the "Ogre Accelerator."  It focuses on demonstrating the core concepts of driver development by simulating matrix multiplication on this virtual device.

## Relevance

This project isn't meant for practical use with real hardware. Instead, it's a valuable educational tool. It simplifies the complexities of real-world driver development, making it easier to grasp fundamental principles like device initialization, data transfer, computation offloading, and resource management. By working with a simulated device, learners can focus on these core concepts without the overhead of interacting with actual hardware.

## Build and Run

This project is built using a standard C compilation process with Make.  Here's how to set up and run the simulation:

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have a C compiler (like GCC), `make`, and standard C libraries installed on your system.  Most Linux distributions and macOS come with these pre-installed. If not, you can typically install them using your system's package manager (e.g., `apt-get`, `brew`).

2. **Clone the repository:** Clone this Git repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

3. **Navigate to the source directory:**

    ```bash
    cd <repository_directory>/src
    ```

4. **Build the project:** Use `make` to compile the code:

   ```bash
   make
   ```
   This will compile the source files and create the `test_ogre` executable.

5. **Execution:** Run the simulation:

   ```bash
   ./test_ogre
   ```
   This will execute the test program, which initializes the virtual Ogre Accelerator, loads sample 3x3 matrices, performs matrix multiplication, prints the resulting matrix to the console, and then cleans up the device resources.


## Code Overview

The codebase is organized into the following files:

- **`ogre_driver.h` & `ogre_driver.c`:**  These files comprise the driver interface. `ogre_driver.h` declares the functions available to users of the driver, such as initialization (`ogre_init`), loading matrices (`ogre_driver_load_matrices`), triggering multiplication (`ogre_driver_multiply`), retrieving results (`ogre_driver_get_result`), and cleanup (`ogre_cleanup`).  `ogre_driver.c` (currently missing but implied) contains the implementation of these functions. This layer abstracts away the details of the virtual device.

- **`ogre_device.h` & `ogre_device.c`:** These files implement the virtual Ogre Accelerator device itself.  `ogre_device.h` defines the `OgreAccelerator` struct, which holds the input matrices (matrix_a, matrix_b), the result matrix, and the size `MATRIX_SIZE`. `ogre_device.c` contains the functions that perform the actual operations on the virtual device: loading matrices (`ogre_load_matrices`), performing multiplication (`ogre_multiply`), and printing the result (`ogre_print_result`).  

- **`test_ogre.c`:** This file contains the main function and serves as a test program for the driver.  It demonstrates how to use the driver's interface to perform a matrix multiplication on the Ogre Accelerator. It initializes the virtual device, loads sample matrices, performs the multiplication, retrieves the result, and cleans up.

- **`Makefile`:** This file automates the build process. It defines the compiler, flags, source files, and build rules. Using `make` simplifies compilation and ensures consistency.
